# React Native boilerplate

This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

This boilerplate contains:

- an empty React Native application created with `react-native init`
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) preconfigured for React Native

## Installation

Make sure you have installed [everything needed to run React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html), then:

- clone this repository
- remove the previous git history: `rm -rf .git/`
- rename the React Native project to your own project name: `npm run rename -- <YourProjectName>` (the default name is `Boilerplate`)

You can now start the application, for example with `react-native run-android`.
