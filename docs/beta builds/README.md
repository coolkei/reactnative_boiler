A lot of developpers loves write React Native code.  
No developer likes to deploy RN app or distribute beta builds.  

All your headaches will disappear with this documentation and the amazing [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) tool :)

You need a Mac. I'm sorry, but if you are a Windows user, you can stop reading right now.  
Fastlane will not work on Windows PC. But in all cases, if you need to deploy your app on IOS, you must have a Mac.

Let's explain which tools we are using to distribute beta builds :
* Fastlane is the easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for your iOS and Android apps. It handles all tedious tasks, like generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your application.
